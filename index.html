				<img id="about-me-image" src="./assets/images/shirley_pix.jpg" alt="Shirley Ramirez">
				<p>Hello! I am Shirley. I am 36 yrs old and was born and raised in the Philippines. I am a wife to my <strong> awesome and ever supported husband </strong> who is in the tech field as well. We have a <strong> wonderful 7 year old son </strong> who was born and raised here in Chandler Arizona. </p>
				<p>I have a degree in Computer technology. I was a DOST(Department of Science and technology) scholar during my college days and that is the main reason why I landed in the Computer technology world. I had my first job as  a Software Developer Engineer in test in Fujitsu Ten Solutions Philippines. I have been on business trip to Japan for a lot of times while working in FTSP.  After 5 years in FTSP, I found an opportunity to work in Japan which gave me new skills and experience to learn more about software programming. I was hired by Soft-service Ltd in Fukuoka Japan. Stayed and lived there for a year before I finally went to US to join my husband.</p>
				<p> What I learned from my first job as a software engineer in test gave me enough knowledge to properly debug electronic control unit software of a car. Was able to do software and hardware testing for ECU too. I was a leader in our group and was the one organizing the meeting for our clients(Japan counterpart). Part of my job was to review member’s output before finally releasing the software to our clients(Fujitsu Ten Limited Japan).  Followed certain steps in software testing such as CMMI methodology. On my second job, I had a chance to be a software developer in Test. I was part of a group to do simulation tool in checking and verifying the software capability of a telephone before releasing the software to our clients.  Did unit test,  regression test and project timeline. Designed and implemented graphic user interphase of the tool as well.</p>
				<p>Currently, I am on a coding bootcamp to enhance my coding skills and become a full stack web developer or jr developer. Excited to find a job and contribute to the company’s success. It give me a sense of accomplishment to do and solve something in software programming. </p>
